It may not have been the fairy-tale ending that Vietnam were dreaming of but John Duerden believes Vietnam have won the real prize at the 2018 AFC U-23 Championship.

While on the balance of play, Uzbekistan deserved to win the final of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championships with a 2-1 win over Vietnam, it was a defeat that was crueller on the Southeast Asians than the arctic conditions.

Andrey Sidorov came off the bench after 118 minutes of tense and tight football and found time to volley home the winning goal to provoke tears on both sides, though of a very different kind.



Uzbekistan’s title-winning campaign has been overlooked a little in comparison to the excitement that was rising in Vietnam. The story of a nation that has been on the brink of World Cup qualification for a number of years has not gripped as much as the journey of Vietnam, a team cheered on by millions of people on the streets of the country as well as the rest of the ASEAN region.

The men in red gave everything but in the end, they could not take the final step and there is nothing wrong with that.

It is safe to say that Vietnam’s players have about as much experience of playing in the snow as they have in major finals. Go to the south of the country in wintertime and locals, sitting outside in the sunshine drinking the local beer, will warn you against heading north to Hanoi, too cold, they say. Make the trip anyway and the daily temperatures of around 16 degrees are pleasant. It’s all relative.

So the final of the 2018 AFC U-23 Championships with Uzbekistan was a tough experience for all – players, referee, fans and those volunteers who cleared the pitch at half-time.

But it is about experience. The past weeks have been a fantastic journey for the players and the country. It is no secret that there are often tensions between the south and the north of the long s-shaped country but all were united in their support for the Golden Stars.

Colleagues and friends talked in wonder of people in markets, restaurants and buses talking excitedly about football, people who had never had any interest in the game. Officials at the Vietnam Football Federation have talked about already having more conversations with the corporate sector as the benefits of getting involved with the sport that really can bring the country together have never been more apparent.

No game played here but ⚽️ drives the entire nation together. Players gave everything. Applaud Vietnam 🇻🇳 for going this far, and so close. Congrats to Uzbekistan 🇺🇿 pic.twitter.com/3XTKSU1aX2

It is also expected that this success will inspire more kids to start kicking a ball around. Of the masses that were out in the streets and in stadiums, there will be more than a few who fall in love with the beautiful game and are inspired to get involved. For the players, there will be offers from overseas and they will need to keep their heads and composure in making career decisions as they have done on the pitch in the past couple of weeks.

Ultimately, Vietnam winning the trophy would have made a good story great but didn’t matter that much. The main prize had already been won. The legacy of this team will be all the above – the bringing together of a country and all the other benefits – and something else. Vietnam have erased any semblance of the inferiority complex that ASEAN teams have had when taking on so-called bigger and better nations on the pitch.

In the past, there have been occasions when there was satisfaction at not getting beat too badly when playing the big boys. The unspoken objective was to show a little skill, play reasonably well but avoid losing too heavily and returning home with heads, not exactly held high, at least unbowed.

 🇻🇳Vietnam U23 can hold their heads high, what an amazing journey from this young group of players. The future of 🇻🇳football is certainly a bright one & congratulations to Uzbekistan 🇺🇿on a fine tournament. #AFCU23 #vietfootball

No longer. Vietnam, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, have demonstrated that ASEAN players are not inferior to those from the west and east. Nobody is expecting victories at every meeting in the future, but the belief that victory is possible can be there. Vietnam still has some way to go to catch up with the likes of Japan, Korea Republic and the rest but the gap is not as big as before and it is not as big as the Vietnamese thought it was. Now teams from this region will know they can win, the results do not have to be a foregone conclusion.

This is the real trophy to take home from China. It is one that shines with confidence and self-belief and it is one that all Southeast Asia can share.


“U23 Uzbekistan xứng đáng giành chiến thắng trong trận chung kết giải U23 châu Á. Thất bại với U23 Việt Nam còn khắc nghiệt hơn trận mưa tuyết như ở Bắc Cực trong suốt trận đấu. Andrey Sidorov vào sân ở phút 118 trong bối cảnh cả hai đội đang thi đấu chắc chắn. Ngay lập tức, cầu thủ này đã ghi bàn quyết định sau cú dứt điểm cận thành. Nước mắt lên trên gương mặt của hai đội theo những trạng thái cảm xúc khác nhau.

Hành trình tới chức vô địch của U23 Uzbekistan ở giải đấu này đã bị lu mờ bởi những cơn địa chấn của U23 Việt Nam. Câu chuyện với đội bóng suýt chút nữa dự World Cup chẳng thể so sánh với Việt Nam. Họ nhận được sự ủng hộ từ hàng triệu người hâm mộ trên khắp mọi miền đất nước. Đó chưa kể tới việc cả khu vực Đông Nam Á đứng sau lưng họ.

Các chàng trai áo đỏ đã cống hiến mọi thứ có thể. Dù không thể đi tới đích cuối cùng nhưng họ cũng chẳng việc gì phải xấu hổ.

Trước trận chung kết, Việt Nam gần như không có kinh nghiệm thi đấu trên mặt sân tuyết. Vào mùa Đông, nếu bạn ghé miền Nam nước này, bạn có thể gọi vài chai bia và thưởng thức dưới ánh nắng vàng. Nếu ngược ra ngoài Bắc, người ta sẽ cảnh báo các bạn về cái lạnh. Dù vậy, nhiệt độ trung bình ở đây cũng chỉ khoảng 16 độ. Khá dễ chịu. Cái lạnh ở đây chỉ mang tính tương đối. Vì vậy, việc phải thi đấu trên sân tuyết, trong điều kiện mưa tuyết là điều vô cùng khó khăn.

Trong thời gian qua, cả đất nước Việt Nam đã chung nhịp đập để ủng hộ “Những ngôi sao vàng”. Tại khu chợ, nhà hàng hay trên xe bus, những người Việt Nam vui vẻ bàn tán về bóng đá, ngay cả những người chưa từng biết trái bóng tròn hay méo. Các quan chức ở Liên đoàn bóng đá Việt Nam đã tăng cường kế hoạch đàm phán với các doanh nghiệp. Bóng đá thực sự đã mang tới sự đồng lòng trên khắp cả nước.

Người ta kỳ vọng rằng sự thành công của U23 Việt Nam sẽ tạo cảm hứng chơi bóng cho những đứa trẻ. Trong số những người xuống đường cổ vũ, sẽ không có ít người bắt đầu ngấm tình yêu với trái bóng tròn. Điều đó sẽ thôi thúc sự phát triển môn bóng đá ở đất nước này. Các cầu thủ Việt Nam cũng nhận được những lời mời chơi bóng ở nước ngoài. Họ cần giữ sự tự tin và đưa ra quyết định đúng đắn như những gì diễn ra trong vài tuần qua.

Nếu U23 Việt Nam nhận giải, câu chuyện cổ tích của họ sẽ thêm chút phép màu nhưng điều đó không thành vấn đề. Họ đã có được giải thưởng quan trọng nhất. Họ đã giúp người dân xích lại gần nhau hơn. Bên cạnh đó, U23 Việt Nam cũng xóa đi định kiến về sự tự ti của những đội bóng ở khu vực Đông Nam Á mỗi khi đối đầu với các đối thủ lớn hơn.

Trong quá khứ, họ đều hài lòng nếu đội bóng không thua quá đậm trước những đối thủ lớn. Họ chỉ cần phô diễn kỹ thuật, chơi ổn và tránh không bị thủng lưới nhiều bàn là có thể ngẩng cao đầu.

Thế nhưng, U23 Việt Nam, ở cấp độ thấp hơn là U23 Malaysia đã chứng minh rằng những cầu thủ ở khu vực Đông Nam Á không hề kém cạnh các đồng nghiệp ở Tây Á và Đông Á. Chẳng ai có thể mong đợi họ giành chiến thắng ở mọi cuộc đối đầu trong tương lai nhưng niềm tin chiến thắng sẽ hiện hữu.

Bóng đá Việt Nam vẫn còn khoảng cách những đội như Nhật Bản, Hàn Quốc nhưng cách biệt đó không còn lớn như nhiều người nghĩ. Giờ đây, những đội bóng ở Đông Nam Á biết rằng họ có thể giành chiến thắng. Kết quả không còn dễ dự đoán như trước.

Đó mới là chiếc cúp lớn nhất mà U23 Việt Nam mang về từ Trung Quốc. Họ đã đoạt được nó bằng niềm tin và sự tự tin lớn. Đó là điều mà các đội bóng khác ở Đông Nam Á có thể học hỏi”.
